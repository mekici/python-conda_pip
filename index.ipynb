    "In dieser Aufgabe importierst Du einen Datensatz, filterst diesen für relevante Variablen und führst auf der Grundlage dieser eine Datenvisualisierung und Analyse der Normalverteilung durch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.) Import des Datensatzes\n",
    "Für dieser Aufgabe nehmen wir einen Datensatz, der direkt über einen Import aus dem Internet verfügbar ist und bei dem es sich um Daten aus dem Bildungskontext handelt, der sowohl kategoriale als auch numerische Variablen hat. Dazu nehmen wir einen fiktionalen Datensatz von Royce Kimmons, der Angaben zu einigen Hintergrundvariablen sowie Testergebnise in Lesen, Schreiben und Mathematik enthält. Dieser Datensatz ist auf Github im Ordner \"Data\" verfügbar.\n",
